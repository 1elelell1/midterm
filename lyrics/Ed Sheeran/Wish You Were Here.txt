so so you think you can tell heaven from hell blue skys from pain can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail a smile from a veil do you think you can tell and did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts hot ashes for trees hot air for a cool breeze cold comfort for change and did you exchange a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage how i wish how i wish you were here we're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl year after year running over the same old ground what have we found the same old fears wish you were here
