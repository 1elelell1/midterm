in hotel rooms far away from home i miss you more than you will know  shine a light just one side to think again that your mine it's high time i'm far away from home  tell me that there's no where left to land and i'll fall down  catch me with the strength of your own hands and i'll fall down  oh i need you without you i'll fall apart and last winter i need you to feed my heart  but all the night sky blue stars are bright shine through like you and i'm far away from home  tell me that there's no where left to land and i'll fall down  catch me with the strength of your own hands and i'll fall down  tell me that there's no where left to land and i'll fall down  catch me with the strength of your own hands and i'll fall down    read more ed sheeran  fall down lyrics  metrolyrics
