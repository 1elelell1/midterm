another day another life passes by just like mine it's not complicated another mind another soul another body to grow old it's not complicated  hook  do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you float down like autumn leaves hush now close your eyes before the sleep and you're miles away and yesterday you were here with me   another tear another cry another place for us to die it's not complicated another life that's gone to waste another light lost from your face it's complicated  hook  is it that it's over or do birds still sing for you float down like autumn leaves hush now close your eyes before the sleep and you're miles away and yesterday you were here with me   ooh how i miss you my symphony played the song that carried you out ooh how i miss you i miss you and i wish you'd stay  hook  do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you float down like autumn leaves hush now close your eyes before the sleep and you're miles away and yesterday you were here with me  hook  do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you float down like autumn leaves hush now close your eyes before the sleep and you're miles away and yesterday you were here with me   touch down like a seven four seven we'll stay out and we'll live forever now
