oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  leaves have fallen to the ground and now there's no one else around to hear the cry  oh oh  i saw your body i saw your face loss of presence loss of grace behind those eyes  oh oh  and we break down we lose touch sometimes we are alone  oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  i miss your laughter i miss your tears i miss your rambling about your fears your smile the crowd has gathered all around no ones speaking no one makes a sound and i  and we break down we lose touch sometimes we are alone  we break down we lose touch sometimes alone  alone now  x5 they're never gonna change you they're never gonna change me they're never gonna change us we'll always stay the same  we break down we lose touch sometimes we are we break down we lose touch sometimes we are we break down we lose touch sometimes we are alone
