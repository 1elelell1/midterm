one two   stop the clocks it's amazing you should see the way the light dances off your hair a million colours of hazel golden and red saturday morning is fading the sun's reflected by the coffee in your hand my eyes are caught in your gaze all over again  pre we were lovedrunk waiting on a miracle tryna find ourselves in the winter snow so alone in love like the world had disappeared oh i won't be silent and i won't let go i will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow and we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears   oh i will hold on to the afterglow oh i will hold on to the afterglow   the weather outside's changing the leaves are buried under six inches of white the radio is playing iron  wine this is a new dimension this is a level where we're losing track of time i'm holding nothing against it except you and i  pre we were lovedrunk waiting on a miracle tryna find ourselves in the winter snow so alone in love like the world had disappeared oh i won't be silent and i won't let go i will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow and we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears   oh i will hold on to the afterglow oh i will hold on to the afterglow oh i will hold on to the afterglow
