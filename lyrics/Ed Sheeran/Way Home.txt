hook well i once heard a story about a rundown home where a man and his thoughts lived all alone he tried to live no effort was shown hes slowly finding a way back home  verse he had a nice family with smiles and frowns they never could solve his way to be down cos hes one dog who dont want a bone hes slowly finding a way back home  he had a nice house with windows and doors he said to his wife whats mine is yours but the seeds of deception are soon to be sown hes slowly finding a way back home  his children have left but the rooms are still there his misses the noise and the scents in their hair but far from the nest the babies have flown hes slowly finding a way back home  his wife was an angel sent from above he never returned her kisses or love but soon hed found that shed overgrown this man whos finding a way back home  so the leaves are all dead in this broken mans june the rain will still fall on the sunny afternoon he stares at the floor no more to roam hes slowly finding a way back home  hook
