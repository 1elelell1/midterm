i should ink my skin with your name and take my passport out again and just replace it see i could do without a tan on my left hand where my fourth finger meets my knuckle and i should run you a hot bath fill it up with bubbles 'cause maybe you're loveable maybe you're my snowflake and your eyes turn from green to gray and in the winter i'll hold you in a cold place and you should never cut your hair 'cause i love the way you flick it off your shoulder  hook and you will never know just how beautiful you are to me but maybe i'm just in love when you wake me up   and would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me could you make me a cup of tea to open my eyes in the right way and i know you love shrek 'cause we've watched it  times and maybe you're hoping for a fairytale too and if your dvd breaks today you should've got a vcr because i've never owned a bluray true say i know i've always been shit at computer games and your brother always beats me and if i lost i go across and chuck all the controllers at the tv and then you laugh at me and be asking me if i'm gonna be home next week and then you lie with me 'til i fall asleep and flutter eye lash on my cheek between the sheets  hook and you will never know just how beautiful you are to me but maybe i'm just in love when you wake me up   and i think you hate the smell of smoke you always try and get me to stop but you drink as much as me and i get drunk a lot so ill take you to the beach and walk along the sand and i'll make you a heart pendant with a pebble held in my hand and i'll carve it like this necklace so the heart falls where your chest is now a piece of me is a piece of the beach and it falls just where it needs to be and rests peacefully so you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now against yours now cos maybe i'm just in love when you wake me up or maybe i'm just in love when you wake me up maybe i fell in love when you woke me up
