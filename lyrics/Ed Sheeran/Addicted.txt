i think i took too much i'm addicted to your touch but i'm crying in shame again  hook  and now i'm high as a kite and i know i might be gone when you get home   oh well we've come this far you're my venus and i'm your mars and we've passed the moon and stars and i'm gone  hook  but now i'm high as a kite and i know i might be gone when you get home i'm high as a kite and i know i'm almost gone when you get home   so please come home
