it's just another night and i'm staring at the moon i saw a shooting star and thought of you i sang a lullaby by the waterside and knew if you were here i'd sing to you you're on the other side as the skyline splits in two i'm miles away from seeing you but i can see the stars from america i wondered do you see them too   so open your eyes and see the way our horizons meet and all of the lights will lead into the night with me and i know these scars will bleed but both of our hearts believe all of these stars will guide us home   i can hear your heart on the radio beat they're playing chasing cars and i thought of us back to the time you were lying next to me i looked across and fell in love so i took your hand back through lamp lit streets i knew everything led back to you so can you see the stars over amsterdam you're the song my heart is beating to   so open your eyes and see the way our horizons meet and all of the lights will lead into the night with me and i know these scars will bleed but both of our hearts believe all of these stars will guide us home   and oh i know and oh i know and oh i can see the stars from america
