help i lost myself again but i remember you don't come back it won't end well but i wish you'd tell me to   our love is six feet under i can't help but wonder if our grave was watered by the rain would roses bloom could roses bloom again   retrace my lips erase your touch it's all too much for me blow away like smoke in air how can you die carelessly   our love is six feet under i can't help but wonder if our grave was watered by the rain would roses bloom could roses bloom   they're playin' our sound layin' us down tonight and all of these clouds crying us back to life but you're cold as a knife   six feet under i can't help but wonder if our grave was watered by the rain bloom bloom again   help i lost myself again but i remember you
