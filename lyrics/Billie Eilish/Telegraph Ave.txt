i don't really want to drive but i think i'd rather die in oakland in oakland with my hands on two and ten so i guess it all depends on oakland on oakland and i'm nervous truth be told i never saw me growing old in oakland in oakland and if i married you tonight it would probably start a riot in oakland in oakland  foot on the gas i'm just tryna pass all the red lights and the stop signs i'm ready to go
