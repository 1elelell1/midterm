breathe the air again it's a beautiful day i wish this moment would stay with the earth some primal paradise but there you go again saying everything ends saying you can't depend on anything or anyone   if the end of the world was near where would you choose to be if there was five more minutes of air would you panic and hide or run for your life or stand here and spend it with me if we had five more minutes would i could i make you happy   and we would live again in the simplest of ways living day after day like some primal animals we would love again under glorious suns with the freedom that comes with the truth   if the end of the world was near where would you choose to be if there was five more minutes of air would you panic and hide or run for your life or stand here and spend it with me if we had five more minutes would i could i make you happy   so it finally came to pass i saw the end of the world saw the madness unfold like some primal burial and i looked back upon armageddon and the moment of truth between you and me   if we had five more minutes of air to breathe and we cried all through it but you spent them with me on our last few drags of air we agree i was and you were happy
