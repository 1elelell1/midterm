kylie minogue they call me the wild rose but my name was elisa day why they call me it i do not know for my name was elisa day    chris martin from the first day i saw her i knew she was the one she stared in my eyes and smiled for her lips were the colour of the roses that grew down the river all bloody and wild    kylie minogue when he knocked on my door and entered the room my trembling subsided in his sure embrace he would be my first man and with a careful hand he wiped at the tears that ran down my face      chris on the second day i brought her a flower she was more beautiful than any woman i'd seen i said do you know where the wild roses grow so sweet and scarlet and free  4  kylie on the second day he came with a single red rose said will you give me your loss and your sorrow i nodded my head as i lay on the bed he said if i show you the roses will you follow    5  kylie on the third day he took me to the river he showed me the roses and we kissed and the last thing i heard was a muttered word as he knelt stood smiling above me with a rock in his fist  6  chris on the last day i took her where the wild roses grow and she lay on the bank the wind light as a thief and i kissed her goodbye said all beauty must die and lent down and planted a rose between her teeth
