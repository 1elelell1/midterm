there's an old song coming on the radio overrun they got us let the garbage grow tell the kids stop feeling for the refugees cause they're not like you and they're not like me   all of the boys they rock and roll cause they don't wanna talk anymore all of the girls get no say in the world just dismissed kiss their kids off to war the lobby lines the diamond mines don't listen to the people who won it's a beautiful beautiful world   there's a new song coming on the radio frutas florecen en todo el mundo let the flowers all blossom the hummingbirds hum we're all born equal under the same sun someone could be you and you could be someone so do to each other as you would be done   all of the boys they rock and roll cause they don't have to hate anymore all of the girls theyre all over the world the sound of the fourtothefloor and everyone is part of the sum riches will rain on the poor say oh ohoh ohohwhoa it's a beautiful beautiful world  you take the noise or you make the noise so sing it like never before say oh ohoh ohohwaoh it's a beautiful beautiful world beautiful beautiful world
