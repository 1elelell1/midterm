there's a wild wind blowing down the corner of my street every night there the headlights are glowing there's a cold war coming on the radio i heard baby it's a violent world   love don't let me go won't you take me where the street lights glow i can hear it coming i can hear the siren sound now my feet won't touch the ground   time came acreeping and time's a loaded gun every road is a ray of light it goes on time only can lead you on still it's such a beautiful night   love don't let me go won't you take me where the street lights glow i can hear it coming like a serenade of sound now my feet won't touch the ground   gravity release me and don't ever hold me down now my feet won't touch the ground
