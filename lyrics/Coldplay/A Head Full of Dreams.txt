ambience  oh i think i landed in a world i hadn't seen when i'm feeling ordinary when i don't know what i mean oh i think i landed where there are miracles at work for the thirst and for the hunger come the conference of birds   saying it's true it's not what it seems leave your broken windows open and in the light just streams and you get a head a head full of dreams you can see the change you wanted be what you want to be and you get a head a head full of dreams into life ive just been spoken with a head full a head full of dreams   oh i think i landed where there are miracles at work when you got me openhanded when you got me lost for words i sing ohohoh   a head full of dreams a head full of dreams into life ive just been woken with a head full a head full of dreams
