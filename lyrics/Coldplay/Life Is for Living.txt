now i never meant to do you wrong that's what i came here to say but if i was wrong then i'm sorry don't let it stand in our way cause my head just aches when i think of the things that i shouldn't have done but life is for living we all know and i don't want to live it alone sing ah ah oh sing ah ah oh and just sing ah ah oh
