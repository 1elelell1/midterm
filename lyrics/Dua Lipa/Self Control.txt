i'll be the boyfriend in your wet dreams tonight noses on a rare little virgin wears the white you cut your hair but you used to live a blonded life wish i was there wish we had grown up on the same advice and our time was right  keep a place for me i'll sleep between y'all it's nothing it's nothing it's nothing keep a place for me for me  now and then you miss it sounds make you cry some nights you dance with tears in your eyes i came to visit 'cause you see me like a ufo that's i never 'cause i made you use your self control and you made me lose my self control my self control  keep a place for me for me i'll sleep between y'all it's nothing keep a place for me it's nothing it's nothing it's nothing it's nothing it's nothing it's nothing
