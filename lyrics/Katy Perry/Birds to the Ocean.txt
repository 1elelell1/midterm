the story we paint is the wish of a dream a hard journey traced by hope how the alignment of the stars my heart longs for something that couldn't stay a true lover of the future burned in the sand  like a scene where i just saw it in my dreams birds fly to the ocean just as we are genuinely free my heart keeps beating as the waves break and the winds carry all the memories that make me return to you
