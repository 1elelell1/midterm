saw your picture on accident your face has changed the lines are sinking in i pressed play i should haven't congratulations but do you ever wonder what we could have been but your mind plays tricks with distance always makes things feel so unfinished  i miss you more than i loved you i do i miss you more than i loved you i wonder what we could have been i miss you more than i loved you i do i miss you more than i loved you i wonder what we could have been  saw a balloon floating away i thought did someone let go or did they lose it so strange you know all my secrets please keep them safe and darling you know i'll do the same you know i'll do the same the window no longer in existence baby you'll always be in my orbit  i miss you more than i loved you i do i miss you more than i loved you i wonder what we could have been i miss you more than i loved you oh i do i miss you more than i loved you  we were a match but not a fake we were a dream unrealistic we didn't lose we didn't win sometimes i wonder what we could have been oh  i miss you more than i loved you oh i do  i miss you more than i loved you i wonder what we could have been i miss you more than i loved you the window no longer in existence oh i do  i miss you more than i loved you you'll always be in my orbit
