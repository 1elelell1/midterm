you could say i lived a crazy life for a man so young the kind that made me question my faith now i'm looking back just wondering where the time has gone but i guess it's just the price you pay i've already loved more than i thought i could love someone i've already felt my heart break yeah i've already fell so many times but i got back up but at least i did it all my way   i've been through it all yeah i've been through it all yeah you won't see me crying if tomorrow never comes god only knows i've been through it all   growing up in this wild city you had to fight or run now you know why i'm not afraid yeah maybe it's my recklessness that got me in trouble but at least i did it all my way   i've been through it all yeah i've been through it all yeah you won't see me crying if tomorrow never comes god only knows i've been through it all   ooh oohooh oohooh oohooh yeah i've been through it all ooh oohooh oohooh oohooh yeah yeah oh mmhmmh mmhmmh   i've been through it all yeah i've been through it all yeah you won't see me crying if tomorrow never comes god only knows i've been through it all you won't see me crying if tomorrow never comes god only knows i've been through it all
