well i get a thrill from down my spine when i see you hittin' me up feelin' so electrified like the heat of a million suns you know just one touch can keep me high and i think i'll never come down 'til a couple days go by and you're nowhere to be found   up all night up all night all the things that you said to me yesterday playin' over in my mind it's a crime it's a crime how you're reelin' me in with the games you play then you hang me out to dry   so i tried to shake you out my head tried to dance with somebody new but you got those lips so red and that smokey voice you do so i know it's pointless anyway 'cause there ain't nobody else that could light me up so bright and break this crazy spell   up all night up all night all the things that you said to me yesterday playin' over in my mind it's a crime it's a crime how you're reelin' me in with the games you play then you hang me out to dry   if i wait a little longer then maybe you'll come back around wait a little longer then maybe you'll be ready now 'cause i would wait forever for you to fall back into my arms so come on   up all night up all night all the things that you said to me yesterday playin' over in my mind it's a crime it's a crime how you're reelin' me in with the games you play then you hang me out to dry up all night up all night all the things that you said to me yesterday playin' over in my mind it's a crime it's a crime how you're reelin' me in with the games you play then you hang me out to dry   how you're reelin' me in with the games you play then you hang me out to dry
