you sing yourself to sleep at night melodies behind closed doors i'm over by the corner listening to you from the second floor   i open up the curtains to hear the thunder and the rain we dropped off all the flowers to wash away the pain   wanna go with you anywhere anywhere wanna go with you anywhere   i'm sorry i kept you waiting i have no excuse there's no room for debating why it took so long to get back to you  4 but these tangerine dreams will not go away i build them right up and mold them out of clay they just give me company now i take everyday with a deep breath 'cause i found out the hard way when he left suffering silently   these last couple days i haven't been myself 'cause i know i won't be seeing you on commonwealth again commonwealth again   these last couple days i haven't been myself 'cause i know i won't be seeing you on commonwealth again commonwealth again
