midnight lock all the doors keep playing that song all day just the sound of the traffic the patron of you switching lanes san diego hard rock hotel wondering why i came i said i'll try not to think of you if you say you don't feel the same   oooh oooh ooh you're reluctant 'cause you know i'll leave you nothing to see oooh oooh i'll be selfdestructing when your beautiful corruption touches me   feels like the end of the world right in this new poor town oooh i should have kept quiet yeah i should have shut my stupid mouth  the long table the boomerang traveling way down south and it's ironic 'cause it's probably the last time that you see me around   oooh oooh ooh you're reluctant 'cause you know i'll leave you nothing to see oh yeah oooh oooh i'll be selfdestructing when your beautiful corruption touches me   i said i'll be selfdestructing when your beautiful corruption touches me
