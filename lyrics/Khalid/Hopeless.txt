spend my time worrying of broken promises focused on the smell of all the burnt out cigarettes my thoughts play on repeat only comfort that i keep 'cause in a moment i will be something you will forget   hopeless hopelessly romantic you you got me stranded ooh i'm blue blue blue   now tell me was i ever something that you could regret i know i wasn't the one for you but at least i tried my best surrounded by questions like why'd you two part ways but if my memorys right you're the one that left   i'll be hopeless hopelessly romantic you you got me stranded ooh i'm blue blue blue   used to lift me higher but i guess our time's expired i'm giving you the match set our love on fire   hopeless hopelessly romantic you you got me stranded ooh i'm blue blue blue   reprise now tell me was i ever something that you could regret i know i wasn't the one for you but at least i tried my best surrounded by questions like why'd you two part ways but if my memorys right you're the one that left   i'll be hopeless hopelessly romantic you you got me stranded ooh i'm blue blue blue ooh yeah i'm blue blue blue oh yeah i'm blue blue blue
