you'd rather speak more than listen and that's based off our first impression i'm new to all this affection but i'm going in the right direction floating through different dimensions but not losing sense of religion honey i forgot to mention i'm so entranced by you it hurts   i'm in love with the moment see me floatin' see me glowin' i'm in love with the moment see me floatin' see me glowin'   can't let me go if i'm fallin' i've been on the path of importance let the love pull you in slowly the river is running we're flowing i'm coming down you've been rollin' and we're letting free now we're open pour me a pour me a potion i'm rocking i'm rocking the motion   i'm in love with the moment see me floatin' see me glowin' i'm in love with the moment see me floatin' see me glowin'   nothing feels better than this now left right left right take it back bring it side to side like that like that ayy ooh now left right left right take it back bring it side to side like nothing feels better than this now left right left right take it back bring it side to side like that like that ayy ooh now left right left right take it back bring it side to side like nothing feels better than this  that made me feel like i'm just speeding doing 60 in a 5 we're sitting in a car and just holding hands
