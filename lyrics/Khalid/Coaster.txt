as time passes i feel so low searchin' for pieces covering up the hole i'll fight for your love i'll fight for your soul i'll throw all of my cares away for you i'll be there to wait for you maybe you weren't the one for me but deep down i wanted you to be i'll still see you in my dreams all the things that i did for you just wasn't it for you   so i'll be coasting rollercoasting through my emotion i will be coasting rollercoasting i'm hoping that you'll come back to me   moving on seems harder to do when the one that you love moves faster than you i gave you my all i showed the proof of your lies and you weren't worth it you don't deserve me as time passes i'm feeling high you're not the one i'm thinking of tonight i may not be over you but i'll try inside i'm feeling better now finally feeling special now oh   coasting rollercoasting in my emotions oh i'll be coasting rollercoasting i noticed you weren't the one for me   you weren't the one for me you weren't the one for me you weren't the one for me you weren't the one for me weren't the one for me you weren't the one you weren't the one for me so don't come back to me no no don't come back to me no no don't come back to me no don't come back to me no no don't come back to me you weren't the one for me you weren't the one for me you weren't the one for me you weren't the one for me
