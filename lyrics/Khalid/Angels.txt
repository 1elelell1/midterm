i've been seeing angels in my living room that have walked the sun and have slept on the moon covered in the fragrance of their own perfume telling me the stories stories coming true well you see these angels these angels see the light yeah i had my troubles troubles all right i've been seeing angels oh no   they'll hold onto their secrets and torn up memories we float above horizons and sail across the seas i hope for better days and lightly times are tough the angels give me strength and i'm not giving up so i wipe away my tears i unveil my pain they're brushing off my shoulders and i hold on to their stain i've been seeing angels   angels angels angels angels angels angels ayy angels
