i've ran away for miles it's gettin' hard for me to breathe 'cause the man that i've been runnin' from is inside of me i tell him keep it quiet so hardly does he speak 'cause he wants to keep his distance but it's hard for him to leave he knows i hear him cryin' cryin' out for help i don't know how to save him i can't even save myself there's many people dyin' i've always been afraid not that i'm scared of livin' i'm scared of feeling pain   i don't need another hand i need a couple suggestions always had a little trouble with selfreflections now does my raw emotion make me less of a man hmm always had a little trouble with selfreflections   i've been so used to winnin' it was hard for me to lose no there's nothing wrong with me there's just something wrong with you so i've been making changes been workin' on my health no more competition can't compete against myself no no no i'm not doin' this to be loved no no i've been doin' this to be remembered let the people hear it if they want to help the one's around me get it on too if i die tomorrow and i'm gone let the blood run high let the carpets drown i'll be forever now   i don't need another hand i need a couple suggestions always had a little trouble with selfreflections now does my raw emotion make me less of a man hmm always had a little trouble with selfreflections i don't need another hand i need a couple suggestions always had a little trouble with selfreflections now does my raw emotion make me less of a man hmm always had a little trouble with selfreflections   let this be a promise that when it's said and done be a flower in the garden be one with the sun be one with the sun be one with the sun be one with the sun be one with the sun
