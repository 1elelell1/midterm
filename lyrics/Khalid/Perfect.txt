ready i can't get this thing to stop squeaking laughs alright ready riley ready    4   i've been on my own for a long time i'm feelin' kinda lonely nothing's fun when i'm the only one out here who knows me something's stopping me from becoming a better person i could try to pace myself but i don't think that it's worth it   what's the point in workin' if a wish is never certain i know i'll never be perfect   i went for a walk last night i swear it was for hours happiness is far from reachin' inside of my power my friends say that i'm changin' changin' like the weather mom says i look sick pop says keep my head up   what's the point in workin' if a wish is never certain i know i'll never be perfect   man i'm thinking out loud where i know someone will hear me cryin' out for help in search of someone near me and i see a growin' boy whenever i look in the mirror told me pain is temporary and my vision's comin' clearer   i'm not used to workin' a wish is never certain i know i'll never be perfect   no no i'm not used to workin' a wish is never certain but at least i'll never be perfect
