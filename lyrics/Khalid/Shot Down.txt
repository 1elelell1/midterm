we've been here before surrounded in the cold you take me to places i've never known and you push me to places i'll never go i would die for you tell me the truth am i all that you would need if we're keeping it a hundred you're all that i need for me from the jump until forever from now i would ride for you   but you got me shot down by love you got my heart now why won't you stop now oh i've been knocked down by you you got my heart now why won't you stop now   i've been through it whole i've been through the worst but i never knew how much our love could hurt over my family i put you first writing out my feelings is the only thing that work i don't hear from the friends i thought were mine too but i hold on to the poems i would write you happy seventeen i saw us two and you saw three i guess our lines are structured like a haiku    you got me shot down by love and you got my heart now why won't you stop now oh i've been knocked down by you and you got my heart now why won't you stop now   knocked down knocked down knocked down knocked down knocked down knocked down   i've been shot down by love you got my heart now why won't you stop now i've been knocked down by you and you got my heart now why won't you stop now
