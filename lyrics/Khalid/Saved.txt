4   the hard part always seems to last forever sometimes i forget that we aren't together deep down in my heart i hope you're doing alright but from time to time i often think of why you aren't mine   but i'll keep your number saved 'cause i hope one day you'll get the sense to call me i'm hoping that you'll say you're missing me the way i'm missing you so i'll keep your number saved 'cause i hope one day i'll get the pride to call you to tell you that no one else is gonna hold you down the way that i do   now i can't say i'll be alright without you and i can't say that i haven't tried to but all your stuff is gone i erased all the pictures from my phone of me and you here's what i'll do   i'll keep your number saved 'cause i hope one day you'll get the sense to call me i'm hoping that you'll say you're missing me the way i'm missing you so i'll keep your number saved 'cause i hope one day i'll get the pride to call you to tell you that no one else is gonna hold you down the way that i do   i hope you think of all the times we shared i hope you'll finally realize i was the only one who cared it's crazy how this love thing seems unfair you won't find a love like mine anywhere   but i'll keep your number saved 'cause i hope one day you'll get the sense to call me i'm hoping that you'll say you're missing me the way i'm missing you so i'll keep your number saved 'cause i hope one day i'll get the pride to call you to tell you that no one else is gonna hold you down the way that i do but i'll keep your number saved 'cause i hope one day you'll get the sense to call me i'm hoping that you'll say you're missing me the way i'm missing you so i'll keep your number saved 'cause i hope one day i'll get the pride to call you to tell you that i'm finally over you i'm finally over you
